# Real-Time Sign Language Recognition System Project

## Overview
This repository contains all the documentation and development artifacts for the Real-Time Sign Language Recognition System project. This system is designed to interpret sign language gestures in real time using advanced machine learning models, thereby enhancing communication accessibility for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. The project was structured into six distinct sprints, each focusing on different aspects of the system's development from initial planning to final deployment and post-mortem analysis.

## Repository Structure
Each folder in this repository corresponds to a different sprint in the project lifecycle. Here is what each folder contains:

- **Sprint 1**: Foundations - Documents related to project initiation, goal setting, and tool selection.
- **Sprint 2**: Planning - Operational planning documents, including workflows and standard operating procedures.
- **Sprint 3**: Refinement - Feedback integration and system refinement documentation.
- **Sprint 4**: CRM Integration - Details on the integration of AI tools with CRM systems.
- **Sprint 5**: Multilingual Support - Documentation on adding multilingual capabilities to the system.
- **Sprint 6**: Adoption - Strategies and feedback on the adoption of the system post-launch.

## Project Goals
The primary goals of this project were to:
1. Develop a scalable and efficient sign language recognition system that can function in real time.
2. Extend the system's capabilities to include multilingual support, thus broadening its usability.
3. Ensure smooth integration of the system within existing technology infrastructures.
4. Foster system adoption through targeted training and comprehensive support structures.

## Technology Stack
- **TensorFlow**: Used for building and training the LSTM model.
- **OpenCV**: Employed for video processing and gesture recognition.
- **CRM Integration**: Tools for synchronizing data across sales, marketing, and support.

## How to Use This Repository
- **Documentation**: Each folder contains documents in PDF or Markdown format. These documents are intended for project stakeholders to review the project's progress and decision-making processes.
